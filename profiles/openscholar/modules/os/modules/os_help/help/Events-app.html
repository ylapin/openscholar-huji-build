<p>The Events app lets you post and manage your events on
your web site.</p>

a primary menu link. The new section displays of the current month's
calendar, as well as other views of upcoming and past events.</p>

<p>You can enter events directly into the calendar by hovering over

saved upcoming events will be displayed. You can also add new events by
clicking on the red <strong> + Add Event </strong> link within the
Events section of your site.</p>

	block of your calendar and its events.</li>
