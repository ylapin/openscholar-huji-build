<p>Apps are optional site components that you can turn on or off.
<p>
<p>OpenScholar provides many Apps, and each one has been designed
and polished to solve a particular use case. Check out available apps
at:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Control Panel &gt; Build &gt; Apps</li>
</ul>
<h3>What's in an app?</h3>
<p>An app generally provides:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A content type, such as a blog, publication or news item.
	<li>
	<li>A site section that showcases the app's content type.</li>
	<li>A menu item that links to the new site section</li>
	<li>One or more widgets, to customize how content is displayed
	across the site</li>
</ul>
<h3>Managing your apps</h3>
<p>When you go to the Apps page in the <a href="The-Control-Panel">Control
Panel</a>, you can set each app to one of three states:
<ul>
	<li>Public: published and accessible to anyone on the web</li>
	<li>Private: hidden to the general public, accessible to admins</li>
	<li>Disabled: hidden and inaccessible to everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>When an App is <strong>Public</strong>, admins on your site will
be able to add and edit content for that app, and configure it's
settings. Most apps provide a content type that will be immediately
publishable to the web.</p>
.
<p>When an App is <strong>Private</strong>, only admins on your site
will be able to see any difference. This can be useful if you want to
provide privately accessed pages, but publically accessible news or
booklet content. Simply enable one module as "Public" and another as
"Private". This is also useful for testing out Apps without exposing
your test content to the whole world.</p>
<p>When an App is <strong>Disabled</strong>, any content or
configuration you have added is hidden, but not deleted. Simply
re-enable an App to restore your previous site section.</p>

<h3>App <a href="Menus">Menu</a> Links</h3>
<p>All Apps provide a menu link, and you can customize how it
appears, by going to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Control Panel &gt; Build &gt; Menu</li>
</ul>
<p>Change the position of a menu link to "Primary menu", "Secondary
menu" or "Not in menu". Additionally, you can edit the menu link to
change the text displayed for that menu item.</p>


<p>Note: If you enable an App as "Private", and keep the menu link
in your primary or secondary menu, then only administrators will see the
menu link.
