<p>The Profiles app allows you to create, categorize, and
publish, profiles of people who are contributors to your project.
Enabling this app will create a section of your site called
"People". To add a profile, browse to the "People" section of your site
and click on the <strong> + Add Person</strong> button.</p>

<p>The Profiles app also comes with a widget called "Categories"
which will display an organized list of people by the category that you
provided when saving the profile. Please note that the "Categories"
widget will only appear if you have created a category when saving the
profile. Categories can be added or changed at any time by editing the
profile.</p>

<p>The Profile app settings allow you to customized the names of
the primary menu link "People" and the name of the widget "Categories".
To access any app's settings, go to the control panel and select
"Apps" and click on the app's corresponding "settings" link.</p>
