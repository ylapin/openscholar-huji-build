<p>Content can be categorized by both app-specific categories, or by
site-wide categories. Categorizing your content can be quite useful to
both you and the users of your site. For instance you may have a blog
entry, a review of a new book on Camus, and you may choose to categorize
this blog post as "Camus", "absurdism", and "literary criticism".
Meanwhile you may also have posted some class material that focused on
literary criticism on a different topic, which you categorize as
"literary criticism". Both the class material and your blog post on
Camus can now appear together if a user searches your site for "literary
criticism" or clicks on the category links that will appear in your
posts.</p>
