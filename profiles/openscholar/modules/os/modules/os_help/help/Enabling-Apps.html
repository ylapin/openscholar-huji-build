<p><strong>Apps </strong>add new functionality to your site.
Enabling an app might give you a new "kind" of content, a new site
section, new widgets or more.</p>

<p>Some apps are enabled by default on every OpenScholar site.
Common default settings for academic institutions are <strong>Publications</strong>,
<strong>Classes</strong>, and <strong>Bio/CV</strong>. You can enable
and configure apps by going to:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Control Panel &gt; Build &gt; Apps</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Many apps also have a variety of settings which you may want
to explore. Further documentation is available for each app into the
<a href="Apps">Apps</a> section.</p>
