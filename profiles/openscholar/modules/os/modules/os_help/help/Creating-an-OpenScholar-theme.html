<p>Themes are HTML, CSS and Javascript that control the overall look
and feel of an OpenScholar site. Every individual OpenScholar site has a
theme, and like the famous <a href="http://csszengarden.com">CSS Zen
Garden site</a>, these themes can display the same content in completely
different ways.</p>
<h3>Developing a Theme</h3>
<p>Custom themes for OpenScholar sites are Drupal themes that are <strong>sub-themes</strong>
of the <strong>'os_base' theme</strong>. You can create clean and
compact CSS by choosing to keep whichever defaults from the base theme
you want. We therefore recommend becoming familiar with the markup we
provide and with the default CSS. This can be done in the usual ways (we
recommend using Firefox and the <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>
extension) but here we also provide some general background.</p>
<p>The base theme uses a markup structure that was featured back in
a <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/holygrail/">2006 issue</a>
of the online magazine A List Apart. We recommend you familiarize
yourself with the basic concepts of the 'Holy Grail' layout.</p>
<p>Beyond your custom CSS and images you'll also need a customized
'.info' file. The .info file (example: 'mytheme.info') resides with your
CSS in your theme folder. It is a proprietary Drupal file which
instructs the system where to find your theme's name, CSS file, whether
there are theme 'flavor' variants, and whether you prefer to have
certain widgets custom enabled.</p>
