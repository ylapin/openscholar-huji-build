<h3>What is a Dataverse?</h3>

<p>Each dataverse hosted by a Dataverse Network is a virtual archive
or organizer of research data. It can contain data sets (called <em>studies</em>)
that are uploaded specifically to that dataverse or that belong to other
dataverses. Data sets can be organized by collections and
sub-collections. In addition to uploading studies and setting up
collections, if you are the dataverse owner (administrator) you can
customize the dataverse browser page.</p>

<h3>How do I create my own Dataverse?</h3>

<p>To create your own dataverse, go to the IQSS Dataverse Network (<code>http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn</code>),
and click <em>Create Your Own Dataverse</em> in the top-right corner of
