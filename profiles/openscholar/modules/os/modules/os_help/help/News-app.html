<p>The News app will enable you to post and manage news that you
would like to publish on your site. Example News items might be recent
developments in projects that you're affiliated with, awards,
course-related updates, a new book or article releases, press mentions,
etc. The News app, like other apps, can be set as private or
public giving you control over how and to whom content is displayed.</p>
<p><strong>Adding News Items</strong></p>
<p>Before taking these steps, make sure the News app is enabled by
viewing <strong>Control Panel > Build > Apps</strong>.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to the "News" menu link in your primary menu.
	<li>In the "+ Add new" dropdown menu, select "News".
	<li>Enter a title, and optional body text, photo, and/or attached
	media files.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip: Categorize with tags.</strong> Each news item can be
categorized in one or more tags, or custom categories you have created
previously. Visitors can also find specific news items by browsing
the categories that you have categorized your news in. You also have the
ability associate images or files with any news item.</p>

<strong>Tip: choose a thumbmnail image.</strong> When you add a photo to
a News item, an automatically formatted thumbnail will display when the
post is listed anywhere on your site. This both looks attractive, and
will help visitors to locate memorable news.
