<p>Your OpenScholar site supports many rich ways to publish, manage,
and showcase your content. These content types are provided when you
enable apps on your site.</p>
<h3>Enable apps for more content types</h3>
<p>To manage what apps are enabled on your site, navigate to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Control Panel > Build > Apps</li>
</ul>
<p>Many apps will provide one or more new content types, as well as
a new page and menu link. For example, once you enable the <strong>Publications</strong>
app, a "Publications" page will appear on your site, as well as a new
content type designed specifically for managing rich and detailed
publication listings.</p>

<h3>Add content from the control panel</h3>
<p>By far the easiest way to create content on your site is the
Control Panel. The control panel is the black administrative horizontal
menu at the top of every page if you are logged in as an administrator
on your site. To add content, simply navigate to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Control Panel > Content > Add... [choose type]</li>
</ul>
<h3>Add content from an app page</h3>
<p>To see what new content types are available from your enabled
apps, you can simply navigate to that app's page. For example, when you
enable the <strong>Publications</strong> app, you will find a new menu
link called "Publications" in your primary menu. Go to this new page and
you will see a button right on the page: the "Add new" link. Only
administrators can see these buttons, and it lets you add content right
on the page where it will be displayed.</p>
<p>Similarly, when you enable the <strong>blog</strong> app and go
to the "Blog" page, you will see an admin link right on the page to add
a new blog entry.</p>

<h3>Rich text editor</h3>
<p>Your site comes with a rich-text editor with options like font
style, lists, images links and much more. If you're only seeing one row
of tools above a text area, click on the right-most icon to see a second
row with even more options.</p>
<p>Tip: If you're familiar with HTML, check out the HTML editor by
clicking "Disable rich text" at the bottom of any rich text editor.</p>

<h4>Controlling the "teaser" break</h4>
<p>Many pages of content will initially show short "teasers" of each
post along with a link to the full page. By default the system will try
to show the first paragraph of your post as the "teaser" but you can
adjust where that teaser break should go. To adjust the teaser break,
move your cursor to the desired location and click the&nbsp;<strong>teaser
break button </strong>(<img class="mceItem" src="path:teaser-break.gif" alt="" />).</p>

<h4>Copying and pasting from other sources</h4>
<p>Many site owners will want to copy and paste material from other
sources such as a word processor document, a PDF file, or an email.
Unfortunately applications like word processors and email clients often
include a lot of unwanted formatting code with each copy/paste. Your
site will ultimately hide unwanted or dangerous code from public view
but it may appear to you in the rich text editor and may be distracting.
To avoid this you can click the <strong>Paste as Plain Text</strong>
button (<img class="mceItem" src="path:paste-plaintext.gif" alt=""
	height="15" width="15" />) which will open a new popup window. By
pasting into this window, all unwanted formatting code is stripped away
entirely. You can then continue to format the text as you like.</p>
