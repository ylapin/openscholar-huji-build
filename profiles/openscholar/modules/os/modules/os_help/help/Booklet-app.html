<p>The Booklet app lets you to create pages that can have a
hierarchical relationship to one another, much like a table of contents.
This kind of structuring is useful for publishing things like sections
of a manual. The hierarchical relationship between pages is a way to
organize related content and provides sensible and direct way for users
to navigate though your booklet pages.</p>

<h2>Creating booklets and booklet pages</h2>
New Booklets are created when creating or editing a booklet page. To add
a booklet page, browse to the "Documents" section of your site and click
on the
<strong> + Add booklet page</strong>
link. Next, you will see a form where you can enter your booklet page
information. In the booklet page form, you will see a "book outline"
drop-down list which will contain the booklet designation for the page
you are creating or editing:
<ul>
	<li>To make your page part of a new booklet, select the following
	from the drop-down list: <strong> '&lt; create a new book
	&gt;' </strong></li>
	<li>If you have at least one booklet saved, you can choose which
	booklet that the new page will belong to by selecting the name of a
	booklet from the drop-down list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Complete the all other applicable fields (Title, Body, tags,
etc.). When you save the form, the page and booklet information will be
saved/created.</p>
<h2>Adding a child page</h2>

<p>Because booklet pages can have a hierarchical relationship, pages
that placed one-level down from an existing page are called "child"
pages. To add a child page to an existing booklet page, browse to the
existing page and click the <strong> Add child page </strong> link at
the bottom. This will load the add booklet page from and automatically
set it as a child page.</p>


<h2>Booklet Settings</h2>
<p>You can customize your Booklet app settings by navigating to
the <strong>Apps</strong> section of the control panel and selecting
the corresponding "customize" link. By default, the Booklet apps
provides primary menu link on your site called "Documents". However you
can customize the name of this menu link in the Booklet app's
settings form.</p>

<h3>Widgets</h3>
<p>The Booklet app comes with a widget that will appear by
default in the right sidebar within the "Documents" section of you site.
This widget will display a list of your booklets and users will be able
to click on the booklet titles to view the content.</p>
