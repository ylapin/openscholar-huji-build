<p>You can manage your apps within the Control Panel by clicking on
the "Build" button. This section will display a list of all available
apps. Each app may be either "disabled" or enabled as "public" or
"private".</p>

<p><strong>Managing a App's Active State</strong></p>
<p>You can manage a app's active state by selecting from the app's
corresponding drop-down menu:</p>

<p><strong>Public</strong> - Selecting "Public" will enable the app
and make all of the app's content available to anyone who visits the
site.<br />
<strong>Private</strong> - Selecting "Private" will enable the app,
however the app's content will only be accessible to the users that you
have chosen. For example, you may have blog that is intended for a
select or trusted audience.<br />
<strong>Disabled</strong> - Selecting "Disabled" will disable or "turn
off" the app.&nbsp; If you disable a app that was previously enabled,
the app's primary menu link, content, and widget will become hidden from
all viewers, however nothing will be deleted. So if you decide to
re-enable the app later, all of your content will re-appear.</p>
<p>Some apps may be enabled by default when you first get your site.
Remember to always click the "Save Settings" button after making any
changes to the apps settings.</p>

<p><strong>Managing a App's Settings<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Most apps will come with some customizable settings. These can be
accessed by clicking the app's corresponding "settings" link in the
Control Panel. Specific settings for each app may vary, but most will
allow you customize the Menu Title and Widget names.</p>
